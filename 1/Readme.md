# start using python to write small code 
In these projects I write four code to solve four problem.


## first problem

I make a calculator to calculate below operation:

1. sqrt    2.sin    3.cos    4.tan    5. cot    6. factorial  7.log    8.sum    9.sub    10.multiplication    11.divide   12.exit
