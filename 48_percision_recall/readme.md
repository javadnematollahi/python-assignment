# Machine learning 11_ precision and recall

In this project I write a class for calculating precision and recall for two or more than two class.


I used surgical database and Surgical.ipynb file from last project and I add my new class and sklearn class to it to
calculate precision and recall for each confusion matric that I earned. 

I put the result for last calculate of confusion matric in result part.
you can see the others calculating in Surgical.ipynb file.
