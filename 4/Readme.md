# File in python

In this part we do some projects to get more familiar with files and arrays in python.


## first problem

In first problem I write code to get name and mobile number of a person and create a QR code for them.

## second problem

In second problem I write code to get a number from user.
Then if user number is a factorial number, below message is shown to user:

n is factorial.

Otherwise below message is shown to user:

n is not factorial.

## third problem

In third problem I write a code that able to define new follower in instagram for a predefined account.

At first you should enter user and password of an account to able the code to connect to instagram. then you should enter the account name that you want to find its new followers.
Then current followers received and they compare with followers of that account that received in the past(for example two days ago befor you get current followers.) and new followers will be shown in terminal.
In fact you should run code one time and after that whenever you run the code again the code will return you new followers of that account.

You must remember that each time you run the code, enter same account, otherwise the code dont work correctly.

In fourth problem I get a list by its member from user and then I reverse it and show in terminal.
