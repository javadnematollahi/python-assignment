# Clock
In these project I create a clock and timer and stop watch and Alarm.

Different part of clock are explained below:

1. World clock:

In worldclock tab the current times of three region are shown. these region include Iran and Germany and USA.

2. ALarm:

In Alarm tab you can set alarm. for this point you must click add new alarm button to add a new alarm. 
when you click set alarm in the set alarm page, the new alarm is set and all alarms will be shown to you.
futhur more you can edit each alarm that you can sety befor by click on edit alarm in front of each alarm.
you can delete each alarm by clicking the remove button in front of each alarm.
and you can on or off each alarm by a toggle button in front of each alarm.

3. Stop watch:

In stop watch tab there is a stopwatch and there are three button ==> start, stop, reset
you can click start to start the timer.
you can click stop to stop the timer.
and you can click reset to make the timer start from zero.

4. Timer:

In tab timer there is a timer. At first you can set your time in timer boxes. after that you can click
start to make timer start. The time decrease until its value reach zero.
you can reset the timer by clicking reset and make it start from the time that you set befor.


This game has below features:

All four part of clock are written by thread. the thread makes different part of code run at same time.
for example you can start timer and stopwatch and set a new alarm and all of these part will be run with each other.




At the end I use pyinstaller library for this project to make an exe file so that you can download only the clock_timer.exe to run the sudoku software.
