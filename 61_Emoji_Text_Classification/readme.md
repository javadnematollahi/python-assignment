# Emoji_text_Classification

In this part we want to calssify text to five class:



## Description

For text classification I use feature of each word. These features are provided by standford NLP team for 6B tokens.

link of word features:

```

##  How to run

Run Below command in terminal to play snake:

```


# results

I use just one dense layer with 5 neuron because I have 5 class.

For 50d feature, loss and accuray were 0.6375,0.8214 and when I add a dropout layer before dense layer the loss and accuray were 0.7824 and 0.8214.
